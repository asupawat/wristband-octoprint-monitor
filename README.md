# wristband-octoprint-monitor
Arduino code for the wristband octoprint monitor I built in Voltlog #320. This code is based on the examples from the original T-Wristband project and from the OctoPrintAPI library.

You will need to set the SSID and password of your wireless router so the ESP32 can connect as well as the ip address of the Octoprint server, the port and the API key.
